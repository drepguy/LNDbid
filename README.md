# LNDbid
LNDbid addon from Guild Legends Never Die to auto bid with addon Community DKP. Create a directory LNDbid in addons folder of your WoW Installation and copy files in this new directory.
## Usage
Start bidding with /bid or /lndb mindkp maxdkp. Example /lndb 10 250 (/bid 10 250).
Then it will start bidding with 10, and if someone makes another bid it will automatically overbid by 5 as long as maxdkp is not reached.
with /lndb stop (/bid stop) you can stop this autobidding procedure manually.
## Restrictions
This Addon depends upon full bidding in Raidchat. If someone bids in a hidden manner this addon can't overbid.
